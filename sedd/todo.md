## Training the score entropy discrete diffusion model
### Logistics
-[X] Add a virtual env for sedd 

### Build the training dataset
- [X] Generate sudoku trajectories (including the masks)
    - [X] Given the mask, need to generate only the forward
    - [X] Then, I need to generate only the actions 
- [X] Figure out how to encode the actions  

## Train the model
- [X] Encode actions or add an encoding layer
- [X] Figure out what cfg should be 


## Adding guidance
- [X] Figure out the denoiser in sampling.py 
- [X]
